I first started this poject back in 8th grade (2013). It's been a while since I have worked on it but the code is still functional.
The main missing component not in the git is the LEAP SDK which you can download at the LEAP Motion website. 

From what I can tell, the code is still functional because of the updates to the SDK, some tweaking will be needed to get back to it's fully functioning state

Google Text-Speech is functional but very slow. The intent was to create an voice-controlled system that could launch OS programs such as Chrome.

Although made mainly with Java, C++ was needed to facilitate OS system calls such as volume control and moving windows around with LEAP
